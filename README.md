# Oligonucleotide Library Assisted Sequence Mining Reveals Promoter Sequences With Distinct Temporal Expression Dynamics For Applications In Curvibacter sp. AEP1-3
This repository contains the code for the promotor sequence analysis for *Curvibacter* sp. AEP1-3. 
To repeat the analysis steps of the manuscript, download this GitHub-Repository, decompress the file in *data/meta_data.tar.xz* and *data/r2aplus_30degree.tar.xz*.

The script *5_prime_utr_curvibacter_sequences.ipynb* was used to search and extract putative promoter regions, as well as to assess those regions for potential binding sites for restriction enzymes.
The script *promotor_project_curvibacter.ipynb* was used to analyse the read counts of the transcriptome analysis and the data obtained from the plate reader measurements.
